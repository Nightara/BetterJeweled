### Welcome to BetterJewelled

This is an x-in-a-row game where you switch neighbouring blocks in order to get combinations of blocks 
and earn as many points as you can.

What is different about this version than others is, we want to make BetterJewelled a more tactical game
instead of a mindless clicker. The biggest difference is, the default mode lets you swap blocks without having
a combination. This way, you can set up your board to make one big combo, giving you more points.

Goal of the game is to get as many points as you want in a certain number of moves, with bigger combos being
more rewarding than many smaller moves.

##

Another feature of BetterJewelled is its modular design, which will allow people to mod the game easily through
extending provided interfaces, creating more game modes.

A stretch goal of the game is to create a duell mode where you can play against a friend on the same board, competing
against one another for who gets the higher score.
